# AMATH-575-Final

## Final project for AMATH 575: Dynamical Systems

### Exploration of stoichiometric constraints for pre-existing ecological models. 
For this project, the paper we used was ``Global dynamics in a stoichiometric food chain model with two limiting nutrients'' by Chen, Fan, and Kuang \cite{CHEN20179}. In their paper, they discuss the problem of modeling ecosystems while considering stoichiometric constraints of the environment. The proposed model they constructed takes into consideration of the constraints that nutrient availability plays on an ecosystem through minimum functions. We propose the incorporatation of new trophic levels into the existing model. Thus, we create a tertiary food chain to further examine the global dynamics of carbon and phosphorus in ecological systems. The inclusion of an apex species which consumed both the consumer and predator was implemented into the model.
